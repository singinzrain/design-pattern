####   The difference between the Factory Method & Abstract Factory
 It lies in their motivations. The factory method pattern is usually responsible for creating a single product whereas an abstract factory pattern creates entire families of related products. Furthermore, in the factory method pattern, we use inheritance to create more specialized products whereas, in an abstract factory pattern, we practice object composition by passing in factories that are consumed to create the desired products.
